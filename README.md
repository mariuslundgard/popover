# popover

This is an exploration into alternative APIs for achieving what [Popper](https://popper.js.org/) and `react-popper` is doing.

The idea is that the same powerful mechanisms can be provided as building blocks (functions and hooks), and make it easier to customize without having to write plugins (i.e. modifiers).

## About this repo

For now, the source code lives in `src/lib/popover.ts`. This might be refactored into an npm package later.

## Run the demo application

```sh
git clone git@github.com:mariuslundgard/popover.git
cd popover
yarn install
yarn dev
open http://localhost:3000
```
